This is the first public release. The project is open-sourced @ [GitHub](https://github.com/Xanot/stats.vipers):

* This is a hobby project. Expect updates on weekends.
* Feature-set is very minimal for this release. Most of the effort went into establishing a strong foundation to build upon.
* No login necessary.
* Expect a domain name sooner or later.
* Do not expect 99.9% uptime.
* Your weapon stat history may get purged once in a while and I won't do it unless it is completely necessary.
